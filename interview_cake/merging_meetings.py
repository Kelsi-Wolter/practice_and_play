# create a function that takes in a list of meetings and returns a list of
# condensed meeting times

# meetings = tuple with start and end times
# end times are representing the num of 30 min blocks past 9am 

# examples:
# meetings = [(0,2), (1,3), (4,6), (3,5)]
# return = [(0,6)]

# meetings = [(0,2), (3,4), (5,6)]
# return = [(0,2), (3,4), (5,6)]

# meetings = [(0,1), (1,2), (3,5), (5,7)]
# return = [(0,2), (3,7)]
