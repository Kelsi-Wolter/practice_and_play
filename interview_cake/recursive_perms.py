# Write a recursive function for generating all permutations of an input string. 
# Return them as a set.

# Don't worry about time or space complexityâ€”if we wanted efficiency 
# we'd write an iterative version.

# To start, assume every character in the input string is unique.

    for each index, it could be any of the letters in the string
    + same function acting on the rest of the indices

    at each indice try each character + recursive call for other indices
